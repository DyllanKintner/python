mad=f"""One day, I was walking through the {place} when I saw a {adjective} {noun1}. It was surrounded by a group of {plural}, all trying to figure out what to do.

Suddenly, the {noun3} started to {verb}, and everyone was {verb2} around it. I ran over to grab my {noun2}, hoping to help.

But instead, I accidentally dropped it into a {place1} full of {plural2}! It was a {adjective1} disaster. In the end, we all laughed and had a {adjective2} time together."""
